## weather-js-shell
A shell script written in node which informs user on local weather details.

You will need an Open Weather API key, [http://openweathermap.org/appid](http://openweathermap.org/appid), then save it to a variable which can be read by the shell script.
```bash
export WEATHER_API_KEY='<put-your-key-into-env>'
```

optionally add vars for `WEATHER_API_LONG` and `WEATHER_API_LAT` *(or just get the weather near me)*.
